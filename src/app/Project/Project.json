    "description": "As the Frontend Developer behind the ForkThis Website for VIT's Gravitas event, I harnessed the power of NEXT.JS and Tailwind CSS to create a transformative platform. Over three eventful days, 100+ students utilized this website to monitor their open-source contributions, track event rankings through a leaderboard, and access a wealth of resources. My work enabled collaboration, fostered innovation, and left a significant mark on the event's success. Explore this project to witness my passion for web development and community empowerment.",
